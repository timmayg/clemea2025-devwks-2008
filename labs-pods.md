<li>SSH to your Pod three (3) times, ADJUST the command below for your Pod ##!</li>

<code> ssh -p 3389 -l ciscolive IP-ADDR-TABLE-ABOVE </code>

SSH Username & Password for the Pod & the Cat9300 switches are all the same.
<br>
**User: ciscolive**
<br>
**Password: ciscolive123**
<br><br>


<li> The first SSH session will be used for managing Ansible and the files. </li>
We will need to change directories to the CLUS folder for this lab. <br>
<code> cd clemea2024-devwks-2008 </code>
<br><br>

<li> Assure you have the latest code & docs from Github!  </li>
<code> git pull </code>
<br><br>

<li> The second SSH session will be a jump box for you to get to the first Cat9300 switch. </li>

SSH Username & Password for the Pod & the Cat9300 switches are all the same.
<br>
**User: ciscolive**

<br>

<li> The third SSH session will be a jump box for you to get to the second Cat9300 switch.</li>

<code> ssh 10.1.1.55 </code>



I arrange my SSH sessions like this for best viewing.   Adjust them for your own preferences.
